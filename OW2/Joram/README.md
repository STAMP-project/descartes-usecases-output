Note: STAMP allowed Joram to fix some bugs in tests (detected by Descartes): Joram issue #313987, contents generated by Descartes ( https://gitlab.ow2.org/joram/joram/issues/313987 ).

The tests described here use Joram *before* the fix, obtained as follows:
```
git clone https://gitlab.ow2.org/joram/joram.git
git checkout 108bf73c
```
(An alternate way to obtain a Joram test version is to clone the joram project in Github STAMP group: https://github.com/STAMP-project/joram ).


Insert config for STP in joram/joram/mom/core/pom.xml

```
          <!--

Build/test joram (from joram/ directory): mvn clean install

cd joram/mom/core
Run Descartes once: mvn eu.stamp-project:pitmp-maven-plugin:descartes

Run DSpot:
mvn eu.stamp-project:dspot-maven:2.1.1-SNAPSHOT:amplify-unit-tests -Dtest-criterion=JacocoCoverageSelector -Dgenerate-new-test-class=true -Diteration=1

DSpot generates 4 amplified tests, with following enhancements:

Initial instruction coverage: 50 / 46858
0,11%
Amplification results with 1 amplified tests.
Amplified instruction coverage: 140 / 46858
0,30%

Initial instruction coverage: 188 / 46858
0,40%
Amplification results with 1 amplified tests.
Amplified instruction coverage: 223 / 46858
0,48%

Initial instruction coverage: 189 / 46858
0,40%
Amplification results with 1 amplified tests.
Amplified instruction coverage: 284 / 46858
0,61%

Initial instruction coverage: 295 / 46858
0,63%
Amplification results with 1 amplified tests.
Amplified instruction coverage: 352 / 46858
0,75%

Copy the new tests in the existing test base:
cp -r target/dspot/output/org src/test/java/
(Note: tests are called "Ampl*Test.java" to avoid confusion in src/test/java ...)

mvn test

Then run Descartes again:
mvn eu.stamp-project:pitmp-maven-plugin:descartes

Compare the 2 descartes outputs (2 directories in /tmp/joram-descartes):
Line Coverage, previously 4% (382/10266), is now 4% (458/10266).
Mutation Coverage, previously 4% (38/991), is now 7% (69/991).

CLEANUP if needed:
rm src/test/java/org/objectweb/joram/mom/*/Ampl*.java
rm -r /tmp/joram-descartes/
